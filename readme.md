Unlike normal Keep-Inventory in Minecraft, where if you die from anything you keep your stuff, this plugin makes the game more competitive while removing the frustrations from dying naturally. It gives your inventory back when you die except if you die due to another player. If you get errors, dm me on discord: canssd#9414.
